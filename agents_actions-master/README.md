Agents Actions: Proposed Darwin Core Archive Extension
=====================================================

See draft extension in [/dwc](https://github.com/tdwg/attribution/tree/master/dwc)

Goal
-----
Create a Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) extension for use in the [GBIF IPT](https://www.gbif.org/ipt) for collections managers to share granular information about the actions individual people and organizations take when managing physical and digital representations of occurrence data. People and organizations here are represented by recognized URIs such as [ORCIDs](https://orcid.org/), [VIAF](https://viaf.org/), or the [HUH Botanist index](http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_index.html).

Background
----------

Presented at Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) annual conference October 1-6, Ottawa, ON, Canada.
